# VRTesting
A little project to test out VR features and interactibles of the VRToolKit, which can be obtained free on the marketplace.
If you don't have an Oculus VR headset, you can always try the game with the simulated VR rig. Controls are always shown on screen.

Uncompress the different .zip on the same folder in order to run the .exe file and play the game!
